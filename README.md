Dr. Jennifer (Jenny) Selgrath works as a social scientist and spatial ecologist with NOAA Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary's science team. She is passionate about incorporating transdisciplinary spatial and social-ecological tools into research, monitoring, conservation, cultural preservation, blue justice, and collaborative management of coastal ecosystems. She focuses on human dimensions of the sanctuary, including ocean access, subsistence fishing, climate impacts, and cultural benefits, on and deep-sea coral habitats. Prior to joining the sanctuary team, she was a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University’s Hopkins Marine Station where she integrated historical ecology and local ecological knowledge to assess biodiversity changes in Monterey Bay over the past two centuries. As a post-doc she also assessed the adaptive capacity of coastal fishing communities to respond to impacts from climate change. Jennifer completed her doctorate degree at the University of British Columbia’s Institute for Oceans and Fisheries with Project Seahorse and the Landscape Ecology Lab (Forest & Conservation Science), her MSc at San Diego State University, and her BA at Wesleyan University where she double majored in Dance and Earth & Environmental Science.
